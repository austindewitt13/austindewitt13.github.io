# Austin DeWitt

I'm a current student attending Deep Dive Java/Android Bootcamp at CNM Ingenuity. I am also an aspiring artist that dabbles in ink and pencil as well as oil paints.


I've travelled across the country and have had many different responsibilities and experiences. Please feel free to see the different positions I've been in on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-dewitt-09b335184/) or check out my [R&eacute;sum&eacute;](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AqA005eV2WcAhhKB4jUW12WO2-OT).
